[Antisyphon info](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/about/)

I heard that Black Hills Information Security (BHIS) training initiative called Antisyphon, and decided to give them a shot!
I took SOC Core Skills V3 in February 2025, just to learn...how much there is to learn!
I already knew it would never stop, but this course gave me some much needed insight into the world of living and breathing cybersecurity!
I look forward to trying out other courses with them!  Here's their [course catalog](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/course-catalog/)!
Here's my list o' courses I'm interested in from them!
